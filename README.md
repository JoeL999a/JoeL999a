- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JoeL999a, based in southern Germany. (Timezone is CET/CEST.)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in photography, darktable, Linux (especially Debian), using FOSS for creative work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning darktable. When I will have made some progress after my first steps I might consider to contribute to it via documentation work (e.g. translation).

- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoeL999a, based in southern Germany. (Timezone is CET/CEST.)
- 👀 I’m interested in photography, darktable, Linux (especially Debian), using FOSS for creative work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning darktable. When I will have made some progress after my first steps I might consider to contribute in documentation work (e.g. translation) for it.

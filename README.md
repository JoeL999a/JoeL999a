- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JoeL999a, based in southern Germany. (Timezone is CET/CEST.)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in photography, darktable, Linux (especially Debian).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning darktable. (When I have made some progress after my first steps I might consider to contribute in documentation work (e.g. translation) for it.)
